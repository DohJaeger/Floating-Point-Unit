# IEEE754_FPU_with_Verilog
This is a 32 bit floating point adder. The inputs are two 32 bit single precision numbers and the the third input is Add_Sub (A_S = 0 => Add else Subtract).
The design flow is as follows : 
* **Prepender**
  * One is concatenated to the MSB of mantissa.
* **Comparator**
  * Both the mantissas are compared, the difference between the exponents and the smaller mantissa is returned.
* **Shifter**
  * The smaller mantissa is right shifted by the difference of the exponents.
* **Sign Out**
  * Based on the sign of Add_Sub and the signs of mantissas, the result sign out is returned
* **ALU_24_bit**
  * The mantissas are insertet to the ALU.
  * IF Carry out is 1, the exponent is incremented and the mantissa is shifted & the 24th bit is set to one
* **Leading zero counter**
  * The number of leading zeros in the above mantissa is counted.
  * Based on the number of zeros, the exponent is decremented to standardize the result.
